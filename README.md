# Music_library
Create your very own music library

A simple web application for creating a music library. 
You upload a music file from which, with the help of the Beagle_buddy jar, you can extract the title and the artist of the song.
With these information and with using the lyrics.ovh and last.fm APIs, you can extract the lyrics and teh cover photo of the song and store it in a database for later use.
